        Since 1800, more than 37 million people worldwide have died while actively
        fighting in wars.
        <br />
        <br />
        The number would be much higher still if it also considered the civilians
        who died due to the fighting, the increased number of deaths from hunger
        and disease resulting from these conflicts, and the deaths in smaller
        conflicts that are not considered wars.1
        <br />
        <br />
        Wars are also terrible in many other ways: they make people’s lives
        insecure, lower their living standards, destroy the environment, and, if
        fought between countries armed with nuclear weapons, can be an existential
        threat to humanity.
